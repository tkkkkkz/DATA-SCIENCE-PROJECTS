## Predicting Red Hat Business Value

This project aims to build a model that employs users' behavioral data to predict if an individual has business value. With an accurate prediction, the company will be able to efficiently prioritize resources to generate more business and better serve their customers.

The dataset contains more than 2 million activities with 52 features. I applied Label Encoding for non-numeric features,and also employed a Random Forest Model for feature selection. In terms of building ML models, I compared 3 algorithms machine learning models (Logistic Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost) by Python scikit-learn. Fine tuned a Random Forest model.

The step-by-step analysis is shared in a Jupyter notebook [Red_Hat_Prediction_final.ipynb](https://github.com/tkkkkkz/Data_Science_Projects/blob/e8fa0bd64f5c6b8cf2e6e6489e009cf649a81908/Predicting%20Red%20Hat%20Business%20Value/Red_Hat_Prediction_final.ipynb).

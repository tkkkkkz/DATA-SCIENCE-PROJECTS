**Hi, this is Tongke :raising_hand:. Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio :smile:!**<br>
<br>This portfolio contains selected capstone projects along with my data science learning. They include my efforts in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. Any comments or suggestions are highly welcomed. 

You could look into the projects in an order of value to me:

This project is to predict the sales of each department in each Walmart store based on historical sales data. Predicting sales data can guide to make strategic sales decisions, plan resources in response to expected demand, and create new marketing initiatives. This project features a detailed data exploratory analysis and data visualization.

This project aims to build a model that employs users' behavioral data to predict if an individual has business value. The dataset contains more than 2 million activities with 52 features. With the prediction model, the company will be able to efficiently prioritize resources to generate more business and better serve their customers.

This project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. There are 10 features of passengers are provided, including gender, age, name, ticket fare, cabin class, etc. This is a classic binary classification problem.

This folder contains my data visualization for Acterra and some coursework. As an Environmental Enthusiast, I worked at Acterra as a volunteer. It is a non-profit organization that aims to combat climate change. To have a better event promotion, I helped them to analyze audience profiles of their events and summarized that information into dashborads.

### About Me

I am an environmental scientist who has a Ph.D. in physics. I enjoy exploring unknowns from data. Also keen to shape my findings into interesting stories and impactful recommendations. 
<br><br>
Before switching to data science, I conducted interdisciplinary research on air pollutants at Stanford. I studied the quantitative assessment of exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke and electronic cigarette vapor. I also model their transport and transform. Feel free to check out my latest research publications [HERE](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L5rUhVwAAAAJ&hl=en)!

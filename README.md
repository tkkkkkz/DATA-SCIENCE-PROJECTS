**Hi, this is Tongke :raising_hand:. Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio :smile:!**<br>
<br>This portfolio contains selected capstone projects along with my data science learning. They include my efforts in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. Any comments or suggestions are highly welcomed. 

You could look into the projects in an order of value to me:

This project is to predict the sales of each department in each Walmart store based on historical sales data. Predicting sales data can guide to make strategic sales decisions, plan resources in response to expected demand, and create new marketing initiatives. This project features detailed data exploratory analysis and data visualization.

This project aims to build a model that uses users' behavioral data to predict if an individual has business value. The dataset contains more than 2 million activities with 52 features. With the prediction model, the company will be able to more efficiently prioritize resources to generate more business and better serve their customers.

### About Me
I am a Ph.D in particle physics. Before switching to data science, I conducted interdisciplinary research at Stanford. My research is to quantify and model the expoure of environmental pollutants. I have used multiply methods to measure and simulate the exposure of secondhand marijuana and electronic cigarette emissions.

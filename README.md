**Hi, this is Tongke :raising_hand:. Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio :smile:!**<br>
<br>This portfolio contains my capstone projects along with my data science learning. They include my efforts on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.

You could look into the projects in an order of value to me:
<ul>
  <li>Walmart Sales Forecast: regression problem, detailed exploratory analysis, various data visualization</li>
  <li>Red Hat Business Value Prediction: classification problem, detailed data wranging </li>
  <li>Titanic--data exploratory analysis, randomforest classification modeling </li>
</ul>
Any comments or suggestions are highly welcomed.

**About Me**
<br><br>
I am a Ph.D in particle physics. Before switching to data science, I conducted interdisciplinary research at Stanford.my research is to quantify the expoure of airborne pollutants to human beings. I have used multiply methods to quantify the exposure of secondhand marijuana emissions, and electronic cigarette emissions in various environmental settings.

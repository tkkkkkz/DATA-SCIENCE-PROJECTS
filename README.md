**Hi, this is Tongke :raising_hand:. Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio :smile:!**<br>
<br>This portfolio contains my capstone projects along with my data science learning. They include my efforts on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling. Any comments or suggestions are highly welcomed. 

You could look into the projects in an order of value to me:

### About Me
I am a Ph.D in particle physics. Before switching to data science, I conducted interdisciplinary research at Stanford.my research is to quantify the expoure of airborne pollutants to human beings. I have used multiply methods to quantify the exposure of secondhand marijuana emissions, and electronic cigarette emissions in various environmental settings.

# DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS
**Hi, this is Tongke Zhao. Welcome to my github profile--data science projects.**<br>
<br>Here I put some of the codes here, hoping to exhibit my skills on exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and data modeling. 

You could look into the project in an order of:
<ul>
  <li>Titanic--data exploratory analysis, randomforest classification modeling</li>
</ul>
<br>Any comments or suggestions are highly welcomed.

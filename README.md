# DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS
Hi, this is Tongke Zhao. Welcome to my github profile--data science projects. 
Here I put some of the codes here, hoping to exhibit my skills on exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and data modeling. 

You could look into the project in an order of:
Titanic--data exploratory analysis, randomforest classification modeling


Any comments or suggestions are highly welcomed.

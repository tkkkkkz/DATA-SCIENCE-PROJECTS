This project contains my files for the Kaggle Titanic project (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

The 'Titanic_Final_Submission' notebook is a step-by-step overview of my data analysis. **It includes a detailed process of data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and a randomforest tree modeling**. It achieves an accuracy of 0.83. 

This project is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Train.csv contains the details of a subset of 891 passengers on board.

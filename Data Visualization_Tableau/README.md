This folder contains my data visualization for Acterra and some coursework. The figures are all created by Tableau. You can see all the figures that end with .png in this folder. All workbooks are complied to the [Tableau Workbook Collection](https://github.com/tkkkkkz/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Data%20Visualization_Tableau/Tableau%20Workbook%20Collection) folder.


As an Environmental Enthusiast, I worked at Acterra as a volunteer. It is a non-profit organization that aims to combat climate change. To have a better event promotion, I helped them to analyze audience profiles of their events and summarized that information into interactive dashborads.

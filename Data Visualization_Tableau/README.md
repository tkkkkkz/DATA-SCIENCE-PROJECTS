This folder contains my data visualization for Acterra and some coursework. 


As an Environmental Enthusiast, I worked at Acterra as a volunteer. It is a non-profit organization that aims to combat climate change. To have a better event promotion, I helped them to analyze audience profiles of their events and summarized that information into interactive dashborads.
